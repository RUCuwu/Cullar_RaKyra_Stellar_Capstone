I created a restaurant website identifying the target audience, 
and defining essential content such as the menu, reservations, About section, team section and contact information. 
The design should reflect the restaurant's brand and atmosphere while being user-friendly and mobile-responsive. 
Key features include a navigation leading you to selected section, interactive photos, and an easy, no tutorial needed user interface. 
Once the design is finalized, the website is developed using tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
and MERN. 
I will continue to make update and improvements to this site.
